My semi biased review :)

Song by Song

1. Hypocritical (Intro Song)
---
# Thoughts
So the accent here sounds russian, but he is croation as far as I know. 
I really like the self-depracating humor (number 1 Edgar Wasser enjoyer).
I will probably never love a synth bass but its used nicely in this track actually making it tolerable.
The critism against party music is warrented and is something he at least tries to avoid in the album, what I greatly appreciate.

2. IG BOY (Song)
---
# Thoughts
Here we seemingly have another character performing the song. For now he wants to become an social media star and thinks rather highly of himself.
The Boy, as i'll be calling him from now on, takes media as a compliment based on the chorus.
Hope we get to see more of him (foreshadowing). 
Has a hymne feeling to it. Very catchy and decent rap sections.

3. Good Boy Lasagna (Song)
---
# Thoughts
Man I love me a good pre-chorus. The rapping sections are meh, but it sounds really good (even found myself unironically bobbing to it).
What is presume is the Boy agains now shows that he has a person he admires(?) to a weird degree. Though based the pre-chorus I like so much
it might be another new character that wants to be a stay at home dad. 
Ill still say its the Boy based on the Bridge "Im yout fool", which matches up with his social media toy desire. I aint doing no kinkshaming.

4. Stress (Song)
---
# Thoughts
Im 99% sure its about drug addictions caused by mental issues. Its given away by "do you have prescreption or are you casual".
It could be the Boy, who based on his previous showing has problems with his selfworth. So he is probably taking prescription meds against
stress caused problems.
The song is a bit slower and lacks the catchyness, which he ironically relies on a bit.

5. and I (Song)
---
# Thoughts
I dont like this song. Maybe because it gives me revival ptsd, but is not good. Maybe even a borderline skip based on the day.
It saves itself with the chorus a bit, but the verses are definitely bad.
We do get more story though. Probably the boy again, who wants to be together with the Baby Lasagna, who is probably the
person Good Boy Lasagna was about form the Boy's perspective. From that we can say that the first track was from Lasagnas perspective.
From that we also see that Lasagna probably wouldnt like the boy based on the lyrics of hypocritical, meaning that the relationship is 
parasocial and could lead to mental and actual trouble for both.

6. Less Than Great (Song)
---
# Thoughts
This sound like a Gorillaz b-side. Very similar sound and structure to feel good inc. Definitely my favourite from the first six tracks.
All of this is just great.
From what I understand the song tells the story of someone (I dont know who) having sexual intercourse with someone else and the 
experience being decent.
Based on the pre-chorus and the first verse it also seems like it only happended because the party telling the story was not only 
lying about things, but was also drunk. The chorus might be from the other persons perspective (I am not sure).

7. Don't hate yourself, but don't love yourself too much (Song)
---
# Thoughts
I dont think its the boy singing this because it would be a contradiction so I guess this might be Lasagna. 
The message is technically true, but what about both (sine-wave-core/bipolar style). The percussion is a bit goofy, but I like it.
The trumpets are also nice.
Solid song overall.

8. Again (type_of_track)
---
# Thoughts
Like the breathing in the pre-chorus. The problem is that every time I hear "Stockholm syndrome" I think of the Stockholm-Syndrom EP and the 
Stockholm Syndrom pair of singles by Edgar Wasser (They're great, you should listen to them, but the EP isnt on streaming).
Song is either about a toxic relationship or someone being groomed. I hope it's the first one. Though its probably the second, when you look 
at the first line of the bridge. 
Might be from the Boys perspective. Would explain his "being owned" kinda shtick. Didnt like the synths in this one.

10. Rim Tim Tagi Dim (Song)
---
# Thoughts
This one is really good. Good metal influence. Tells the story a soemone going up and leaving. So probably backstory for the Boy.
Also a track I was bobing to. Very catchy and tells a good story.

11. Catch Me If You Can (Song)
---
# Thoughts
Jay-Z MENTIONED LESGOO (specifically a reference to 99 Problems).
This is probably another character. This could be Lasagna backstory, but i dont know. He wants to do things differently and not sit
on the throne, which would align more with Lasagna, so that's my headcannon.
Decent song. Also sounds like one of the Beatsaber songs from the first freepack (specifically Escape by Jaroslav Beck and Summer Haze).

12. Biggie Boom Boom (Song)
---
# Thoughts
A good song. Sounds a bit like something they'd sing in a stadium. The song is from the perspective of a personification of either stress,
depression, both or imposter syndrome. Based on verse 2 its probably the first or the latter. Whaterver it is, it seems o be affecting the boy, 
who is suffering from anxiety as seen in "Stress".
Is also pretty catchy.

13. Dopamine (Song)
---
# Thoughts
I dont like the PSA at the start. I think the minor chords and lyrics would have spoken for themselves and the start ruins the 
atmosphere. It feels like the PSA before "Radicals" on "Goblin" by Tyler, the Creator or the "Double Entendre" adlib on "Darkness" by Eminem.
Things like that ruin songs. People who wouldnt have figured out the message you wanted to convey dont listen to the lyrics anyway.
That  out of the way, I must say, that the song is pretty good. It's not revevutionary and the concepts is pretty milked dry, but 
it's nicely executed. Though my favourite song of the kind will always be "Deja Vu" by Eminem.
Also has a similar soundscape to "Es schiebt" by Herr Kuchen (also has a very similar theme).
Could be anybodies perspective, so i'll say it is removed from the general story or belongs to the Boy.

14. Demons & Mosquitos (Outro Song)
---
# Thoughts
The song is nice. With some imagination it could be a Mitski song.
I like it. 
Storywise it might be the boy coming to grips with himself. My headcannon is that is actually a personal song, because id like it more if it was.
Definitely my favourite from the record together with "Less Than Great".

Conclusion:
If I was a House music enjoyer this would maybe have been one of my favourites. The storytelling was consistenly great and music quality
only dipped once or twice. 
Could the vocals have been better? Yes.
Could the rapping have been better? Definitely, Yes.
Does it take away from the message? No, Not really.
The album is enjoyable and, while not my cup of tea, worth a relisten here and there.
The first half is far more consistent though.

Favourite Tracks:
- Less Than Great
- Demons & Mosquitos
- Rim Tim Tagi Dim
