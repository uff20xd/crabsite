LEGION by Creepy Nuts - My semi unbiased review

Track 1: 22nd year of junior high school (Intro)
------------------------------------------------------
Its an interesting Song. It sounds kinda mysterious and has a rather dark atmosphere. I have no idea what its about though since i dont speak japanese.
Meh as an intro.

Chorus: 5
Overall: 4.3

Track 4: japanese
------------------------------------------------------
I like this one. J-rap with a flow that maybe a bit choppy but good otherwise. Sounds a bit like Eminems flow on tonedeaf or like an older Kollegah flow.

Lyrics: -
Verses: 8
Chorus: 7
Overall: 7.3
------------------------------------------------------

Track 5: Chxxai

NOOOOO screaming vocals on an obnoxious phonk beat. As an avid Eminem listener I am able to look over the beat but the rest of the song aint that good either.
Probs my least favourite from the album.

Conclusion

This album is really hit or miss. It has some great songs but for someone who doesnt speak the language it kinda doesnt fit together in any fashion.
They they just splashed random songs on there (Bling-Bang-Bang-Born was released more than a year ago) and called it an album. More of a mixtape kinda thing. 
Does more things good than bad so id call it an all around success.

Rating: 6.3

Highlights:
- Bling-Bang-Bang-Born
- Tsujokai
- japanese
- Otonoke
- doppelgänger
